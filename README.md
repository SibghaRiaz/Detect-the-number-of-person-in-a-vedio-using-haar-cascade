# Detect-the-number-of-person-in-a-vedio-using-haar-cascade
The problem is to tag the people present in the video and also count them. If any new person enters or leave the frame the algorithm should tackle it. To solve this problem the techniques that is used in the project is Haar feature based cascade classifiers. It is machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. Then it is used to detect object in other images or video. By using haar cascade function detect the face of a person and make the rectangles around the faces after that these rectangles are used to count the number of persons in a video. The algorithm is also able to compensate the variation in light if we vary the lighting effect it also able to detect the face of a person.
